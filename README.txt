A game to help get my head around pygame.

The mouse pointer controls a ball. Other balls appear in random
positions and are either attracted or repelled to you.  

By clicking the mouse you can "switch polarity" so that the
balls that were attracted to you are repelled and those that were
repelled are attracted to you.

Clicking the mouse increases your score by 1000 points
